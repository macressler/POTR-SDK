__Welcome to the Postcard On The Run SDK Github__

We have SDKs for iOS, Android, and Windows 7 Phone that allow you to share in postcard revenue and offer postcarding to your users.

In order to integrate our SDKs please sign up by visiting http://api.postcardontherun.com. 
Click the "sign up" link in the lower left hand corner, follow the instructions, and proceed with signup.

You will receive an email with an API Key when we have enabled your account.  That key allows you to access the 
Postcard on the Run API via an SDK.

The SDKs can each be found inside their folder above.  At this time only our iOS SDK is available here, 
but our Android and Windows SDKs will be available here by the end of June 2013.

For iOS documentation please see https://github.com/POTR/POTR-SDK/wiki/iOS-SDK-Documentation 

Feel free to email us at api@postcardontherun.com with any questions.

Thanks for your interest!
