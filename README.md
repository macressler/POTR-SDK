__Welcome to the Postcard On The Run SDK Github__

We have SDKs for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone that allow you to share in postcard revenue and 
offer postcarding to your users.  After including a Postcard On The Run (POTR) SDK in your app 
your customers will be able to create real postcards delivered by mail to their friends and loved ones. 
Once you add the embedded framework to your project, simply supply an image and the POTR SDK will 
create a view controller guiding your user through the steps of creating and paying for a postcard.

The POTR SDK is tightly integrated with our Postal Gopher web service. When your customer wants to 
send a postcard to a contact on their phone that does not have a mailing address, Postal Gopher will 
send them an email or SMS text message. The contact will have 48 hours to respond with an address 
to mail the postcard to. Because Postal Gopher is included with the POTR SDK, you do not need to do 
anything to take advantage of this service.


__Postcard On The Run Partner Website__

In order to integrate our SDKs please sign up by visiting http://api.postcardontherun.com. 
Click the "sign up" link in the lower left hand corner, follow the instructions, and proceed with signup.
When we enable your account you will receive an email with an API Key.  That key allows you to access the 
Postcard on the Run API via an SDK.

You can login via username/password at the POTR partner website to change the pricing of postcards created via your app 
and create promo codes for customer incentives and promotions.  You will receive earning reports and payments 
based on postcard sales originating from your app.  We identify your sales via your API key.

__SDKs and Documentation__

The SDKs can each be found inside their folder above.  At this time only our iOS SDK is available here, 
but our Android and Windows SDKs will be available here by the end of June 2013.

For iOS documentation please see https://github.com/POTR/POTR-SDK/wiki/iOS-SDK-Documentation
