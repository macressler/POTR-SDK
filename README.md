__Welcome to the Postcard On The Run SDK Github__

We have SDKs for iOS and Android that allow you to offer postcarding to your users and share in postcard revenue.  
After including a Postcard On The Run (POTR) SDK in your app your customers will be able to create real postcards 
that are delivered by mail. Once you integrate the embedded framework to your project the POTR SDK will 
create a view controller which guides your user through the steps of creating and paying for a postcard.

POTR sets the retail price of postcards purchased via our SDK.  The current retail price is $2.49 per postcard although
promotions may affect this price.

__SDK Revenue Sharing__

We pay out $1.00 per postcard purchased via a partner SDK which is paid out within three weeks after 
the end of each calendar year quarter.  

Alternatively your company can pre-pay for postcards with a pre-negotiated "whole sale" rate. This allows your users to send postcards free 
of charge via a promo code which prepopulates in the SDK.  and they have your app/call to action branding printed on the back of the postcard.

__Postal Gopher__

The POTR SDK is tightly integrated with our Postal Gopher web service. When your customer wants to 
send a postcard to a contact on their phone that does not have a mailing address, Postal Gopher will 
send them an email or SMS text message. The contact will have 48 hours to respond with an address 
to mail the postcard to. Because Postal Gopher is included with the POTR SDK, you do not need to do 
anything additional to take advantage of this service.

__Getting Started__

In order to integrate our SDKs please sign up by visiting http://api.postcardontherun.com.  Click the "sign up" link in the lower left hand corner, follow the instructions, and proceed with signup.
When we enable your account you will receive an email with an API Key.  That key allows you to access the 
Postcard on the Run API via an SDK.

You can login via username/password at the POTR partner website to view orders. Your sales are identified via your API key.

__SDKs and Documentation__

The SDKs can each be found inside their folder above.  At this time only our iOS SDK is available here, 
but an updated version of our Android SDK will be available here by the end of June 2013.

For iOS documentation please see https://github.com/POTR/POTR-SDK/wiki/iOS-SDK-Documentation
